although last week he warned he would not sign for a club based on fulfilling a nationality quota.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Gunners' 23-year-old star, who scored his first England goals in Sunday's win over Slovenia, was fined \u00a340,000 and warned about his future conduct on Wednesday after admitting a charge of making inciting comments during Arsenal\u0092s open-top bus celebrations following their victory in last month\u0092s FA Cup final.<\/p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Liverpool made it clear they are currently in no mood to do business with City over winger Sterling, who has refused to sign a new contract.<\/p>\r\n<p>The American-owned Reds are adamant City will need to add millions to their offer and have also told them they will accept only a cash deal - with no players added in to bump up the value.<\/p>\r\n<p>City had tried to include the likes of strikers Edin Dzeko, Stevan Jovetic and Alvaro Negredo in their early negotiations.<\/p>\r\n<p>Liverpool's principal shareholders John Henry and Mike Gordon were immersed in meetings on Wednesday, where they indicated their stance hasn\u0092t changed from a position which bluntly stated they have no need to sell.<\/p>\r\n<p>City have done one deal for an English-born player, though.<\/p>","image_url":"http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/images\/thursday\/stdzexmnazkvwzgrwh.JPG","created_at":"2015-06-19 09:32:12"},{"id":21,"news_type":"4","title":"Arsenal confirm Japanese international winger Miyaichi exit\r\n","slug":"\/sports\/article\/2000166236\/arsenal-confirm-japanese-international-winger-miyaichi-exit","content":"<p>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/sports\/search?q=Arsenal\"> Arsenal<\/a>\r\non Thursday confirmed that Japanese international winger Ryo Miyaichi has left the club to join\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/sports\/search?q=German\"> German<\/a>\r\noutfit St Pauli.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Miyaichi, 22, joined the Gunners in January 2011 but made only a handful of first-team appearances, spending loan spells at Feyenoord, Bolton Wanderers, Wigan Athletic and FC Twente.<\/p>\r\n<p>He leaves at the same time as defender Semi Ajayi, who has gone to Cardiff City.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>Miyaichi has signed a three-year deal with St Pauli, the Hamburg-based club who finished just one point above the relegation zone in the second tier of the Bundesliga last season.<\/p>","image_url":"http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/images\/thursday\/stdjmlgdinu.jpg","created_at":"2015-06-19 09:37:11"},{"id":22,"news_type":"4","title":"Brazil's Neymar suspended for one match\r\n","slug":"\/sports\/article\/2000166240\/brazil-s-neymar-suspended-for-one-match","content":"<p>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/sports\/search?q=Brazilian\"> Brazilian<\/a>\r\nstar Neymar has been provisionally suspended for one match and could face a harsher final punishment, officials said Thursday after the striker received a red card during a fracas in Brazil's Copa America loss to Colombia.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>South American federation CONMEBOL's disciplinary committee \"provisionally suspended Neymar for one game after his behavior in the aftermath of Brazil's 1-0 defeat to Colombia, and will meet on Friday to decide the final punishment,\" said a statement on the Copa America website.<\/p>\r\n<p>Colombia upset the five-time world champions in a combative game Wednesday that ended in a tumultuous melee, as Neymar appeared to aim a headbutt at Colombian goalscorer Jeison Murillo.<\/p>\r\n<p>Colombian striker Carlos Bacca also received a red card for pushing Neymar from behind.<\/p>\r\n<p>Neymar had previously received a second yellow card for a handball, meaning at least a one-game suspension was inevitable.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"mid-advert\" ;=\"\">\r\n<p>The Barcelona star had received a first yellow card during Brazil's opening win against Peru.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Copa America website initially reported a two-game suspension, but later clarified that the 23-year-old striker was suspended for one game in a preliminary decision, to be reviewed when the disciplinary committee meets Friday.<\/p>\r\n<p>A two-match suspension would rule him out of Brazil's final group game against Venezuela Sunday and any quarter-final clash.<\/p>\r\n<p>There was already bad blood between Neymar and the Colombian team heading into the match.<\/p>\r\n<p>He suffered a fractured vertebra when Colombia's Juan Camilo Zuniga collided with him in their World Cup quarter-final clash last July, an injury that sidelined him for the rest of the tournament.<\/p>\r\n<p>Wednesday's match left Group C of the South American championship up for grabs, with three teams tied at three points each: Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela.<\/p>","image_url":"http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/images\/thursday\/stdvsnazchc.jpg","created_at":"2015-06-19 09:44:10"},{"id":23,"news_type":"4","title":"Kamau relieved of coaching duties at Post Rangers\r\n","slug":"\/sports\/article\/2000166253\/kamau-relieved-of-coaching-duties-at-post-rangers","content":"<p>John Kamau\u0092s tenure as Posta Rangers head coach came to an end on Tuesday after the coach was \u0091redeployed\u0092 hardly six months after taking charge at the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Premier League side. Kamau joined Rangers from Kenyan Premier League (KPL) side Thika United.<\/p>\r\n<p>His redeployment was confirmed by Rangers Chairman John Tonui who announced that George Maina will take charge in an acting capacity.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u0093It has been decided that Kamau be redeployed to another department in the corporation as he is still an employee of Posta. This was a necessary move as we want to improve results on the pitch,\u0094 said Tonui.<\/p>\r\n<p>Other sources in the team, however, revealed that Kamau could not get along with the senior players something that is attributed to the team\u0092s slow start in the league.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u0093Kamau is used to working with youthful players. He was finding it difficult to work with the experienced players and that is why the team has been struggling. It became so bad that some players threatened not to get on the pitch if he is still the coach and that is why he was moved,\u0094 said our source.<\/p>\r\n<p>The coach could not be reached for a comment but people close to him say he is contemplating quitting rather than taking up the new role.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u0093His place is on the pitch and he would rather quit than accept the new position, which means he has to work in an office,\u0094 said the source. But Kamau\u0092s choices look limited at the moment as he may be forced to take up an assistant role in any of the top local clubs.<\/p>\r\n<p>Elsewhere, trouble continues at AFC Leopards after members of the newly appointed caretaker committee announced they have stepped down over what they termed as interference in their duties.<\/p>\r\n<p>Caretaker Committee Chairman Amin Walji said in a statement that resistance from the current executive committee club has made it impossible for them to carry out their duties.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u0093 The resistance and sabotage has made it impossible for us to take care of the welfare of the team. The fight over who is in charge has denied us the legitimacy of mobilizing funds for the same.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u0093More so, the in-fighting has not helped especially with prospective corporate sponsors who are confused about who\u0092s is in charge.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u0093We wish them success and are more than willing to reconvene when and if our services are required,\u0094 said Walji in a statement.<\/p>","image_url":"http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/images\/thursday\/stdzopwzwpmj.JPG","created_at":"2015-06-19 09:48:12"},{"id":24,"news_type":"4","title":"KTTA IN CHARM OFFENSIVE: Association out to revamp inactive branches\r\n","slug":"\/sports\/article\/2000166262\/ktta-in-charm-offensive-association-out-to-revamp-inactive-branches","content":"<p>Kenya Table Tennis Association (KTTA) has initiated a move to revamp its branches which have been inactive for years due to wrangles.<\/p>\r\n<p>The association, preparing to conduct its trials for the forthcoming All Africa Games set for Congo Brazzaville (September 4\u009619), has embarked on an offensive to tap and groom young talent across the country.

The branch Secretary Christopher Mutungi and treasurer General George Muiya received the equipment at Nairobi Sports House.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Association is calling on the government to offer equal support to to all sports disciplines.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mudibo added: \u0093The government has neglected many sports.
